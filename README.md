## Project Overview

The Network Topology project enables users to:

1. **Create a Network Topology** with routers and hosts.
2. **Configure Routing** between different network segments.
3. **Test Connectivity** between network nodes.
4. **Simulate Traffic** and measure bandwidth.

This system uses **Mininet** to create and manage the network topology.

---

## Features

1. **Add Routers and Hosts**  
   Users can add routers and hosts with specified IP addresses and MAC addresses.

2. **Configure Links**  
   Links between nodes can be configured with specified bandwidth.

3. **Routing Configuration**  
   Configure routing tables for routers to enable communication between different network segments.

4. **Connectivity Testing**  
   Test connectivity between nodes using ping.

5. **Traffic Simulation**  
   Simulate traffic between hosts using iperf.

---

## Network Topology

The network topology consists of:

-   **4 Routers** (r1, r2, r3, r4)
-   **2 Hosts** (h1, h2)
-   **Links** with specified bandwidths

## How to Use

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://gitclone.com/github.com/filzarahma/Build-Topology-dengan-Mininet.git
```

### Step 2: Run the Python Script

The project is intended to be run using **Mininet** on a **Linux** system. If you are using Windows, you can use **WSL2** or a virtual machine like **VirtualBox**.

1. Ensure Mininet is installed on your system:

```bash
sudo apt install mininet
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script:

```bash
sudo python Mininet.py
```

or

```bash
sudo python3 Mininet.py
```

### Step 3: Follow Interactive CLI

The system offers an interactive CLI for managing the network topology.

---

## Test Cases

Below are the predefined test cases to verify system functionality:

1. **Test Connectivity**  
   Test connectivity between all nodes using ping.

2. **Simulate Traffic**  
   Simulate traffic between hosts using iperf.

---

## Code Description

-   **`Mininet.py`**: Contains the implementation of the network topology, routing configuration, and testing functions.

### Key Functions:

-   **`run`**: Sets up the network topology and starts the Mininet CLI.
-   **`test_connectivity`**: Tests connectivity between nodes using ping.
-   **`test_traffic`**: Simulates traffic between hosts using iperf.

---

## Dependencies

This project requires:

-   **Mininet**
-   **Python 2.7 or 3.x**

No external libraries are needed.

---

## Example Usage
